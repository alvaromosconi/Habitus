# Habitus Backend


This project is a backend API for a habit management application, built with ASP.NET Core 7. The API provides endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving habits, as well as scheduling reminders for them. The API uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server for data persistence and Hangfire for background tasks. The API also integrates with Telegram to send notifications to users via a bot. The backend is deployed on Azure and uses Azure Key Vault for storing secrets.
